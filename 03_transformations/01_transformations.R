# 2.0 ROLLING & SMOOTHING ----
# - Common time series operations to visualize trend
# - A simple transformation that can help create improve features 
# - Can help with outlier-effect reduction & trend detection
# - Note: Businesses often use a rolling average as a forecasting technique 
#   - A rolling average forecast is usually sub-optimal (good opportunity for you!)

# * Sliding / Rolling Functions ----



# * LOESS smoother ----



# * Rolling Correlations ----
# - Identify changing relationships




# * Problem with Moving Avg Forecasting ----





# 3.0 RANGE REDUCTION ----
# - Used in visualization to overlay series
# - Used in ML for models that are affected by feature magnitude (e.g. linear regression)

# * Normalize to Range (0,1) ----
# - INFO: recipes::step_range() is actually normalization to range(0,1)



# * Standardize to Mean = 0 (Center), SD = 1 (Scaling) -----
# - INFO: recipes::step_normalize() is actually standardization to mean = 0, sd = 1




# 4.0 IMPUTING & OUTLIER CLEANING ----
# - Imputation helps with filling gaps (if needed)
# - Outlier removal helps linear regression detect trend and reduces high leverage points
# WARNING: Make sure you check outliers against events 
# - usually there is a reason for large values

# * Imputation ----


# * Cleaning (Imputation + Outlier Removal) ----



# Outlier Effect - Before Cleaning



# Outlier Effect - After Cleaning




# 5.0 LAGS & DIFFERENCING -----
# - Used to go from growth to change
# - Makes a series "stationary" (potentially)
# - MOST IMPORTANT - Can possibly use lagged variables in a model, if lags are correlated & 

# * Lags ----
# - Often used for feature engineering
# - Autocorrelation
# - 



# * Differencing ----
# - Makes a series "stationary"
# - Used to get change
#   - Stock price changes
#   - Cumulative Revenue to change by day
#   - Total subs to change by day

# Cumulative Sum & Differencing



# Comparing Differences 



# Inversion 




# 6.0 FOURIER SERIES ----
# - Useful for incorporating seasonality & autocorrelation
# - BENEFIT: Don't need a lag, just need a frequency (based on your time index)

# * Vector (Single Fourier) ----


# * Augmenting (Multiple Fourier Series) ----




# 7.0 CONFINED INTERVAL FORECASTING ----
# - Showcase: log_interval_vec()
# - Transformation used to confine forecasts to a max/min interval
